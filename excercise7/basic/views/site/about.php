     <h1>Jhenina Monique &#9752</h1>
  <p>A free-spirited girl who loves discovering new things and new adventures</p>
  <p> I am Jhenina Sta. Cruz! You can call me Nina. I would love to describe myself but I am currently a storybook that is being written. Therfore, I have no other words to describe who am I but really an optimist person and enthusiastic. </p>
  
<p>I would consider myself an opposite of a typical millenial, because I am an inquisitive person. I enjoy thinking about reality and things in life that do mattter, I am considered to be responsible and determined by many. A girl like me is easy to get along with because I love interacting with peopple and learning from them. I would also consider myself a goal-oriented person because all I want in life is success. Success to give a helpiing hand to those in need, and especially to my family. I crave for spiritual fulfillment that I could create and inspire people through my works of photography and writing. 
</p>
<p>Some facts about me is that I love poetry and writing so much aka I have a blog of my own. I think everything's correlated with each other that's why I also love photography because each photo has it's own story to tell. I love nature, and learning new things. Also, my hobbies including playing the guitar and singing. </p>
  <p>Hello, you!</p>
